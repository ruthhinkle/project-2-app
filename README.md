## How to Use
<details> <summary markdown="span"><strong> üìç Check Nearby Stations</strong></summary>
  To find a bike, check nearby stations and look at their status to see if there are bikes available. Light-blue pins indicate  stations full of bikes, dark-blue pins indicate stations with less than 5 bikes, and red pins indicate empty stations. When you're done with your ride, red stations are great place to drop off your bike.
