# Plan Your Divvy Trip

See Chicago up close when you bike around the city. Use this page to plan a trip, find the closest bike station, and bike to the nearest landmark.

If you like to plan ahead, pick out a landmark or two and find the closest stations by looking at the map.

<details> <summary markdown="span"><strong> 🚲 Find Your Bike</strong></summary>
  Stations are color-coded on the map to indicate how many bikes are availabe. Look first for Full Stations where you'll have your pick of bike. Low stations have less than 5 bikes available, so avoid them unless your party is small and you're very close! You can't pick up bikes at Empty Stations, but you can drop bikes off there when you are done!

    Keep an eye out for popular landmarks and even restaurants on the map! Each destination has a unique icon so you can find it on the map.
